# devreg

A Flutter project for `Device Registration` invocation on Smart Contract

## Getting started

The Smart Contract is located at [devreg_solidity](https://github.com/mhishami/devreg_solidity).
Clone those codes, compile, and deploy the Smart Contract to get the address, and ABI definitions to be used here.

## Running The App

The app is broken down into 3 steps:
  1. The scaffold codes
  2. The UI components
  3. The Smart Contract integration
  
Change into the specific branch to see the progress, and run the app in the simulator, or direct into your hardware by connecting through USB cable.

e.g.:
```bash
git checkout step3
```
to run the final app, after changing the server parameters, the ABI and the Smart Contract address.
