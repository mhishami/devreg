# devreg

A Flutter project for `Device Registration` invocation on Smart Contract

## Getting started

The Smart Contract is located on [devreg_solidity](https://github.com/mhishami/devreg_solidity).
Clone those codes, compile, and deploy the Smart Contract to get the address, and ABI definitions to be used here.
